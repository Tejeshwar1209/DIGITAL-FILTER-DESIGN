##In this task, the objective was to design and simulate a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) digital filter using Verilog. FIR filters are a type of digital filter widely used in signal processing applications due to their stability and linear phase properties.

We implemented a 4-tap low-pass FIR filter using Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL). The design includes shift registers to store previous input samples and a set of fixed filter coefficients that multiply with the inputs to produce the filtered output. The convolution sum of these weighted inputs generates the desired output at each clock cycle.

The Verilog code was written modularly, with parameters to define the filter order (number of taps) and customizable coefficients for flexibility. The filter was simulated to observe its response to a sequence of input signals. The simulation results demonstrated that the filter output stabilizes after a few clock cycles, as expected from the FIR filter behavior.

The deliverables for this task include:

The Verilog code implementing the FIR filter.

Sample simulation results, showing the filter response to different input sequences.

A performance analysis, highlighting the advantages and limitations of FIR filters, such as their inherent stability, linear phase response, and higher resource usage compared to IIR filters.

This task provided hands-on experience in digital filter design, HDL coding, and understanding the trade-offs involved in hardware implementation of signal processing algorithm.
